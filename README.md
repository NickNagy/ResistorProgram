# ResistorProgram

(in progress) 
Two implementations (C++ and Java) of an application that allows the user to design and evaluate resistor circuits.

The feature of particular interest is an algorithm that returns to the user an arrangement of resistors (from their given collection) with a net resistance ~= a requested value.

**Note:** the C++ implementation has only been tested on Linux (Ubuntu 16.04) and requires OpenGL to compile.
