# ResistorProgram

(in progress)
 
Two implementations (C++ and Java) of an application that allows the user to design and evaluate resistor circuits.

The feature of particular interest is an algorithm that returns to the user an arrangement of resistors (from their given collection) with a net resistance ~= a requested value.

**Note:** the C++ implementation has only been tested on Linux (Ubuntu 16.04) and requires OpenGL to compile.

--------------

# C++ Implementation

(in progress)

**circuit:** defines CircuitEdge and CircuitMatrix classes. These are used to build and measure resistive circuits.

**circuitgraphics:** defines the functions for the graphical component of the program. **Uses OpenGL.**

**globals:** global variables!

**helpers:** defines a number of functions that are used by different files in the program.

**main:** runs the entire program and defines the algorithm for searching for a circuit with the desired equivalent resistance.
